        We are two school friends with a passion for flavoursome food, we want
        to build a positive culture around authentic food cooked fresh to order
        with high quality ingredients.

        During the Covid-19 lockdown we watched restaurants close & large events
        cancelled but noticed some food truck vendors were still trading. We
        wanted to be a part of this trend as we see a revolution in catering
        towards street food & deliveries.

        The beauty of mobile catering is that we are able to interact with
        guests on a personal level and express our passion for food to them. We
        love the fast paced environment and challenges to face on a daily basis.
        In comparison to restaurants, chefs often are stuck behind the scenes
        and donâ€™t get the fulfillment from seeing a customer smile after that
        first bite. Our memories of home cooked food, travelling the world and
        working in London food events forged our passion & appreciation for the
        flavours of many great cuisines. We want to share these inspirations
        with others through our food. As a business we aim to reduce our
        environmental impact by eliminating single use plastics & sourcing local
        produce, as well as introducing biodegradable packaging. The healthy
        aspect of our food and the good energy we bring creates an atmosphere
        that people want to be a part of. Our ultimate goal is for our guests to
        be completely satisfied.
