            We are two school friends with a passion for flavoursome food, we
            want to build a positive culture around authentic food cooked fresh
            to order with high quality ingredients.

            During the Covid-19 lockdown we watched restaurants close & large
            events cancelled but noticed some food truck vendors were still
            trading. We wanted to be a part of this trend as we see a revolution
            in catering towards street food & deliveries.

            The beauty of mobile catering is that we are able to interact with
            guests on a personal level and express our passion for food to them.
            We love the fast paced environment and challenges to face on a daily
            basis. In comparison to restaurants, chefs often are stuck behind
            the scenes and donâ€™t get the fulfillment from seeing a customer
            smile after that first bite.

            Our memories of home cooked food, travelling the world and working
            in London food events forged our passion & appreciation for the
            flavours of many great cuisines. We want to share these inspirations
            with others through our food.

            As a business we aim to reduce our environmental impact by
            eliminating single use plastics & sourcing local produce, as well as
            introducing biodegradable packaging. The healthy aspect of our food
            and the good energy we bring creates an atmosphere that people want
            to be a part of. Our ultimate goal is for our guests to be
            completely satisfied.
