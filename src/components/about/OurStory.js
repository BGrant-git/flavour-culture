      `During the Covid-19 lockdown we watched restaurants close & large
      events cancelled but noticed some food truck vendors were still
      trading. We wanted to be a part of this trend as we see a
      revolution in catering towards street food & deliveries.`,

    [
      `The beauty of mobile catering is that we are able to interact with
      guests on a personal level and express our passion for food to
      them. We love the fast paced environment and challenges to face on
      a daily basis. In comparison to restaurants, chefs often are stuck
      behind the scenes and donâ€™t get the fulfillment from seeing a
      customer smile after that first bite.`,
    ],
    [
      `Our memories of home cooked food, travelling the world and working
      in London food events forged our passion & appreciation for the
      flavours of many great cuisines. We want to share these
      inspirations with others through our food.`,
    ],
    [
      `As a business we aim to reduce our environmental impact by
      eliminating single use plastics & sourcing local produce, as well
      as introducing biodegradable packaging. The healthy aspect of our
      food and the good energy we bring creates an atmosphere that
      people want to be a part of. Our ultimate goal is for our guests
      to be completely satisfied.`,
